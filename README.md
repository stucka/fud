# What is this I don't even

This is the very beginnings of a project to parse Georgia restaurant 
inspection data, being done in off-hours.

No, this isn't really a public project yet, but Github makes it too easy 
to synchronize projects on multiple computers.

Pull requests, comments and suggestions are welcomed.
